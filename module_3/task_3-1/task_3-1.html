      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[When the wake-up time is 7 i can take the bus to school, and do not need to wait for the train or take the car. If the wake-up time is 8, i can take the train to school. But if the wake-up time is other than 7 or 8, i have to take the car to school.]</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[If its not 7 I take the car, otherwise I take the bus.]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[If its less than 7, I take the car. If it is greater than 8, I can take the train. ]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      <p>[If the integer is exactly 0, it is going to print out 0. If it is negative, its going to print out negative and positive if it is positive.]</p>
