      <li>[1. What is the difference between invoking and creating a function?]
      <p>[Answer: A function is defining/declaring a function. The function can be defined once, but you can still use is later in the code. Invoking means to execute the function you created.]
      <li>[2. Explain the syntax regarding semicolons and code blocks.]
      <p>[Answer: The semicolons and code blocks are the key to the code working. Without, the code wont go through. To terminate statements in Javascript we use semicolons. Which is a period to a sentence, so we know that the statement has ended. W usually use codeblocks to define the body of function, loops and conditionals.]
      <li>[3. What happens when we try to store values from a function when it doesn't return any?]
      <p>[The value we try to store, would end up being "undefined". When a function doesn't return a statement, they will be "undefined".]
      <li>[4. How do we separate parameters from each other when creating a function?]
      <p>[When we are creating a function and defining it, the parameters are going to be separated by commas.]
      <li>[5. Explain how parameter names are related during the invocation and creation of a function.]
      <p>[The parameters names is a declaration in the function we are using. Which means they are placeholders, they work so that the code can accept arguments.]
      <li>[6. Explain why a parameter is undefined when a function call is missing a parameter.]
      <p>[If we call a function with less arguments than the parameters defined, the missing parameters will be "undefined". You have to pass a value.]
      <li>[7. Explain what happens when we use recursive functions.]
      <p>[If we use a recursive function in Javascript, this will call itself to fix the problem. This technique will repeatedly call itself with different arguments, to hopefully reach the problem.]
