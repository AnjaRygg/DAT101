      <li>[What is an array? A short and concise answer is expected here!]</li>
      <p>[An array is a way to store a group of elements in one variable, where each item can be accessed using its index.]</p>
      <li>[What does it mean to "hardcode" when we talk about programming? (In English, it's called "hardcoding", "hard-coding", or "hardcoding").]</li>
      <p>["Hardcoding" means putting fixed values directly into the code instead of using variables or external sources. This makes it difficult to change the values without editing the code itself.]</p>
      <li>[Explain in plain text what happens in task 3, and how we can traverse (iterate) the array when we (humans) don't "know" how long the array is.]</li>
      <p>[In Task 3, we're working with an array, but we don't know how many items it has. To solve this, we can use a loop to go through each item in the array one by one, without needing to know the total number of items ahead of time. We can use a loop, like a for loop or the forEach method, which will automatically go through each item and stop when it reaches the end. In JavaScript, we can use the .length property of the array to find out how many items there are, and the loop will stop once it processes all the items.]</p>
      <li>[Why is it beneficial to store instances of a class in arrays, as in task 4?]</li>
      <p>[Storing class instances in arrays helps organize multiple objects in one place, making it easier to manage and access them. Arrays allow us to loop through and perform actions on all objects at once, and it's simple to add or remove objects as needed. This approach makes the code more efficient and easier to read when working with multiple instances. ]</p>
      <li>[Try your best to explain the EWeekDays object from task 7. How do we use the "value" attribute, for example? In what way do "WeekDay", "Workdays", and "Weekends" differ from each other? If we wanted to create a new element "WorkoutDays", which would contain "Monday", "Wednesday", and "Thursday", how would it ideally look? (I will choose the best answer to this task and reward it with pizza in the cafeteria right after New Year. Remember to mark in your submission if you want to participate in the competition!)]</li>

      <li>[In task 8, we will use a "callback" routine when sorting. Explain how such a "callback" routine works.]</li>
      <p>[A callback routine is a function you provide to a sorting algorithm to define how two items should be compared. The sorting algorithm calls this function whenever it needs to decide the order of two items.]</p>
      <li>[What happens in the sorting routines you have created? Try to explain how the array can figure out if an element should come before or after another. The best way to answer this is to actually print both parameters each time the sorting routine runs.]</li>
      <p>[When a sorting program runs, it doesn’t magically know which number (or item) should go first or second. Instead, it keeps comparing two items at a time to figure this out. Each time it compares two items, it decides if the first one should come before the second one or if the first one should come after the second one. Also if they are equal and can stay in the same place.]</p>
      <li>[In task 10, we will create an array with rows and columns. Explain what the first element of the array contains.]</li>
      <p>[In a 2D array, the first element is the one in the very top-left corner. It’s in the first row and the first column. You can find it using array[0][0]. ]</p>
