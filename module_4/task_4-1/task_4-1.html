      <li>[Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?]</li>
      <p>[Object-oriented development offers a structured and modular way to design and build software. It simplifies complexity by concealing the inner workings of the system. Additionally, it encourages keeping certain details hidden, which improves security and minimizes accidental interference.]</p>
      <li>[In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and how this type of object can help us in software development.]</li>
      <p>[A static object like AccountType is used to define a fixed set of related values or categories that don’t change. Using clear names like AccountType.SAVINGS instead of random strings or numbers makes the code more understandable.]</p>
      <li>[Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class? Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.]</li>
      <p>[Encapsulation is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where we group data and methods into a class and limit direct access to some parts. This protects an object’s internal state by blocking unauthorized or accidental changes. By hiding certain details, we ensure that data can only be accessed or changed in a controlled way.]</p>
      <li>[Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript?]</li>
      <p>[When we use the new keyword in JavaScript, it sets up a new, empty object in memory that isn’t connected to anything else yet.]</p>
