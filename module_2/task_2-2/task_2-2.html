        <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
        <p>
          [When you use constants you can not change the values. For the values that may be changed or modified you should use variables.
          To work effectively with programming, the use of both is going to speed the process. 
          If you only use constants in programming, you would not be able to change the value without rewriting the code.]
        </p>
        <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
        <p>
          [Parentheses is being used to close the code before you start a new one, and ensure that the parts are being completed.
          This also makes it easier to solve and understand the code before the outcome.]
        </p>
        <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
        <p>
          [With limit the numbers of decimals you can use “toFixed()” and limit the decimals to how many you want. 
          This is a simple and effective way for limit numbers, when you have many decimals. 
          You can also use the phrase “Math.round()” to limit the decimals in the code. 
          This is a more flexible method for use in mathematical codes.]
        </p>
        <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
        <p>
          [To compare floating-point values, we need to define a tolerance to set a boundary of how close the values are going to be. 
          Which means that you are deciding what considers equal with the two numbers. 
          Function (areEqualWithTolerance).]
        </p>
        <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
        <p>
          [The comparison operators is generally comparing two values, true or false. 
          If we want to check if two values are equal, we can use (==). 
          Example (2 == 2) will return true, cause they are equal. 
          Also if we want to check if the two values are equal without type coercion, we can use example (2 === 2) which will return false.]
        </p>
        <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
        <p>
          [Math.random() is a function that generates a random number. 
          Also it is a random outcome to generate between a minimum and maximum value, which you can decide the output of.]
        </p>
        <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
        <p>
          [If you want to divide two numbers, this modulus returns what is left after the division. 
          Which means that it is calculating the numbers you want to divide.]
